# TotalFootball

This web app displays real time soccer matches, stats, and news. [Click here to visit](https://totalfootball.owenevey.com).

It is a Vue app using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is an AWS backend that uses S3 and DynamoDB to store data. Soccer data is fetched from [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com).

Due to using private API keys, this project is unable to run by others as the data will not load.
